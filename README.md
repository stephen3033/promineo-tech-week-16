# Week 16 Project

## Description
- This project is the built front end for my Italian to English Translator/Dictionary
- The translation API is not implemented yet because I am going to be hosting that myself
- The open-source project LibreTranslate will be the translation layer on the next iteration
- I am still searching for a solution to the dictionary API
- This app was built using react, react-bootstrap, and react-router to change pages
- It can complete all CRUD operations
- It uses a backing array to store the favorites and history of translated words
